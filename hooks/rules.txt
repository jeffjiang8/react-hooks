Rules:

1. only call hooks at the top level: don't call hooks inside of loops, conditionals, or nested functions

2. only call hooks in React functions, not in js functions, make sure all stateful logics are clearly visible from its source code

3. React relies on the order in which the hooks are called to know which state corresponds which useState call
